This folder contains analyses for growth vs. biomass.

Three analyses were done, which all use the same analytical approach (i.e., code) applied to different versions of the dataset.

1. The main analysis using the entire growth vs. biomass dataset (main paper) is: [FIA_nls3_BiomassG_plotB_FINAL.html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/hoganhaben/FIA-forest-dynamics/blob/main/Growth-Biomass/FIA_nls3_BiomassG_plotB_FINAL.html)
 
2. A "temporally-balanced" plot biomass growth vs. plot biomass dataset, where only one growth measurement per plot per decade (2000-2010, and 2011-2020) was considered (in cases where plots had more than 2 records, we used the first and last measurements).  A second alternative dataset is analysed, which is "temporally-balanced", but also excludes plots where harvest occured (at any point over the study period: 2000-2022).

3. A second additional analysis which uses additional growth estimators (1. G_MassBal_g5_MgHaYr - mass-balnce growth for trees ≥5 inches, or ≥12.5 cm dbh, and 2. G_obs_TreeInc_NoIngrow_MgHaYr - summed tree incremental growth for trees ≥5 inches, or ≥12.5 cm dbh, excluding ingrowth trees).   These analyses show results which are qualtitively consistent and vary little from the main analysis. They are included in one file, one after another.
