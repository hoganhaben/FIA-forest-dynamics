This folder contains analyses of plot biomass growth - plot biomass relationships.

Three analyses were done.  All us the same analytical approach (i.e., code) applied to different versions of the dataset.

1. The entire plot biomass growth vs. plot biomass dataset

2. A "temporally-balanced" plot biomass growth vs. plot biomass dataset, where only one growth measurement per decade (2000-2010, and 2011-2020) were considered (in cases where plots had more than 2 records, we used the first and last measurements).

3.  A "temporally-balanced" plot biomass growth vs. plot biomass dataset, excluding plots which experienced timber harvest.
