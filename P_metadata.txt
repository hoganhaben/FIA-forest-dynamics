Overview:
The Create_P.R script uses the USFS FIA state data tables (the TREE, PLOT, CONDITION, and SURVEY tables) to create a processed data product for plot-level biomass that is used in one of Biomass-Stand Age analyses (see FIA_nls3_plotB_StdAge.Rmd).  The method sums the product of the dry biomass and the FIA expansion factors for all living trees in an FIA plot measurement.  Derived quantities in the P_dataset are described below.

Variable  descriptions:
pltID: pltID: a unique plot identifier, denoted a the concatenated UNITCD, STATECD, COUNTYCD, and PLOT number (separated by "_").

CN: The FIA PLOT table Sequence Number, which uniquely identifies a plot record.

SURV_CN: The FIA SURVEY CN that links the SURVEY table to the PLOT table

MEASYEAR: The year in which the plot was measured from the FIA PLOT table.

MEASMON: The month in which the plot was measured from the FIA PLOT table.

INVYR: The USFS panel year which best represents when the t2 inventory data were collected.

REMPER: The USFS remeasurement period, defined as the number of years between successive plot measurements (accurate to the 0.1 years).

LAT: Plot latitude in decimal degrees using the NAD83 datum.

LON: Plot longitude in decimal degrees using the NAD83 datum.

ECOSUBCD: The USFS ecological subsection code, defined as areas of the same surface geology, soil conditions, climate, and potential natural forest communities. See Cleland et al 2007 (http://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/pubs/48672), and additional details in the FIA DB user guide (https://www.fia.fs.usda.gov/library/database-documentation/index.php).

STATE: Two-letter state abbreviation. 

BIO_MgHa: Plot biomass in Mg/Ha, calculated as the summed product of tree biomass (DRY_BIO) and FIA expansion factors (TPHa) for all living trees. 

CARB_MgHa: Plot Carbon density in Mg/Ha, calculated as the plot biomass times 0.5 (a rough estimate of average wood density).

MEASTIME: The decimal-year measurement time of the plot, calculated from FIA PLOT table as MEASYEAR + (MEASMON-0.5)/12.

PLOT: the plot number from the FIA PLOT table

STDAGE: The FIA reported stand age from the FIA CONDITION table. Stand age is estimated using tree core data (See FIA DB and field methods documentation). Annual inventory data have stand ages assigned to the nearest year.

STDORGCD: The Stand Origin Code from the FIA CONDITION table.  Zero denotes natural stands, and one denotes a plot with clear evidence of artificial regeneration. 

COND_STATUS_CD:

CONDPROP_UNADJ: The Condition Proportion Unadjusted from the FIA CONDITION table for that plot record. The unadjusted proportion of the FIA plot that is in the condition.

STDSZCD: The Site Productivity Class code from the FIA CONDITION table for that plot record.  The classes are (in ft^3 wood production/ac/yr): class 1: 225+, class 2: 165-224, class 3: 120-164, class 4: 85-119, class 5: 50-84, class 6: 20-49, and class 7: 0-19.

SITECLCD: The Stand-size Class Code from the FIA CONDITION table for that plot record. Codes 1-3 denote stocked first stand (i.e., those with a predominant diameter of live trees - stocking values of at least 10), whereas codes 5 denote non-stocked stands (i.e., forest lands with <10 live stocking values). 

PHYSCLCD: Physiographic Class Code from the FIA CONDITION table.  It describes the general effect of landform, topographical position, and soil on the moisture available to trees. Can be broadly classified as xeric, mesic, and hydric (but see details in FIA DB documentation). 

GSSTKCD: The Growing-stock Stocking Code from the FIA CONDITION table, which is a code indicating the stocking of the condition by growing-stock trees, including seedlings. 

P3_OZONE_IND: Phase 3 Ozone Indicator (logical) from the FIA SURVEY table.  Y denotes surveys that are part of the P3 Ozone inventories. 

ANN_INVENTORY: Annual Inventory indicator from the FIA SURVEY table. Y means that inventory is annual (as opposed to periodic). 

ECOPROVCD: The USFS ecological province code, which are landscape scale classifications of US forest areas.  Refactored from ECOSUBCD, as a higher-order classification (see Cleland et al 2007).

Notes & other considerations: 

1. Unit conversions - Before any calculations, units were converted from imperial/standard units to metric equivalents (e.g., from per acres to per hectare values for FIA expansion factors, and lbs to Mg for tree dry biomass values).

2. The archived dataset has undergone plot selection (i.e., filtering). Seven plot selection criteria were used: a) excluded plantation forests, b) only including plots with a single condition using a 95% threshold for CONDPROP_UNADJ, c) excluding non-productive stands, d) excluding non-stocked stands, e) excluding non-accessible forest plots, f, and g) only including data from FIA annual inventories,
