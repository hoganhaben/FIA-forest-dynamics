This folder contains code for the procssing of PDSI (Palmer Drought Severity Index) rasters from the PRISM Climate group. 

The PRISM Climate Group archives, collates and develops spaitial climate datasets (many of which are for the coterminous USA).  see: https://prism.oregonstate.edu/

The Palmer Drought Severity Index is calculated using precipitation and temperature data as a metric of relative climate dryness.  The index is based on a physical water balance model and empircal temperature data.  It successfully captures landscape variation in drought and evapotranspiration (a key climatic control on drought development and severity), at annual and supraannual scales.  It ranges from -10 (dry) to +10 (wet), but typically spans a -4 to +4 range.  For more invromation see Palmer 1965, Dai 2011)

Archived PRISM dataproducts (raster files) were obtained from the Western Regional Climate Center (wrcc.dri.edu) dataportal.  https://wrcc.dri.edu/wwdt/data/PRISM/pdsi/
We recommend you access the data directly.

In our analysese PDSI is incorpated as a change in PDSI Î”.  We explored several ways of incorporating PDSI data into our analyses, experimenting with the monthly temporal window to consider and various time periods for baseline vs. observed values.
